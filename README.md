# xlsx2vcf-converter
This python program makes use of Pandas module which needs to be installed for this converter to work. 

It takes a XLSX file and convert all the contacts present in it to mobile compatible VCF file. 

The input for excel file should be as: 

1st Column for FirstName, 

2nd Column for LastName and 

3rd Column for Telephone number. 

Pass the file name as the argument while executing the convert.py file. 

Command is as follows: python3 convert.py fileName.xlsx

I tested this program on 2500 contacts and it works fine.
